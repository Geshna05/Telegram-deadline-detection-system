** Why is this important? **

In today’s fast-paced world, important messages often get buried under a flood of group chats, channel updates, and forwarded messages. Many people miss deadlines or job opportunities just because they get lost in the noise.

This system ensures:

You never miss a deadline announced in an important Telegram channel.
You catch job notifications, scholarship updates, or registration deadlines the moment they drop.
You can scroll through Telegram stress-free, knowing your bot is keeping watch.
